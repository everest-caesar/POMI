# Quick Steps to Create GitHub Repositories

Follow these steps to create the two repos, then I'll push them for you.

## Step 1: Create Frontend Repository

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Fill in:
   - **Repository name**: `pomi-frontend`
   - **Description**: "POMI Frontend - React + Vite + TypeScript"
   - **Public** (or Private if you prefer)
3. **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT check "Initialize with README"
4. Click **Create repository**
5. You'll see a page with the repo URL

## Step 2: Create Backend Repository

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Fill in:
   - **Repository name**: `pomi-backend`
   - **Description**: "POMI Backend - Express.js + Node.js"
   - **Public** (or Private if you prefer)
3. **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT check "Initialize with README"
4. Click **Create repository**
5. You'll see a page with the repo URL

## Step 3: Tell Me When Done

Once both repos are created, just say "Done" and I'll:
1. Push frontend code
2. Push backend code
3. Provide you the URLs to connect to Netlify and Railway

That's it! The repos should look empty when you create them.
