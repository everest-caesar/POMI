List available AutomatosX agents.

**IMPORTANT**: When user types `/ax:list`, you MUST execute:

```bash
automatosx list agents
```

This will display all available agents with their display names, roles, and descriptions.

**Example**:

User input: `/ax:list`
→ Execute: `automatosx list agents`

Expected output shows all agents including:
- Built-in agents (assistant, coder, reviewer, debugger, writer, etc.)
- Custom agents (if any created in `.automatosx/agents/`)
